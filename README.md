streetnetwork
=============

This is a project to generate a LP-solve problem for street networks. It is calculating flows on steets between junctions, based on the probabiltiy of turns or going straight. When generated then it also will be solved

To make this program work:
	- install lp_solve commnand line http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/
